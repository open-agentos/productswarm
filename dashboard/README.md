# Swarm dashboard

A read-only page showing what every agent session is doing. Built by `generate.py`: Python stdlib only, one static HTML file, no JavaScript (option 1 in gov question #26, which the owner chose).

## Generate it

```bash
python3 dashboard/generate.py            # writes dashboard/out/index.html (git-ignored)
open dashboard/out/index.html
```

Options: `--repo owner/name` (default: this checkout's `origin`), `--out PATH`, `--days N` (include sessions that stopped in the last N days, default 14), `--idle-minutes N` (default 15).

It reads GitHub through `gh api`, so inside a swarm session it acts as the role's App.

## Where it's published

`.github/workflows/dashboard.yml` regenerates the page every 15 minutes (plus a manual run) and publishes it to GitHub Pages at <https://open-agentos.github.io/productswarm/>. It runs on a schedule only, never on issue, comment or PR events, and its token can read the repo but not write to it (`pages` and `id-token` are only for the deploy), per the owner's choice on #32.

The page is **public**, because this repo is. It shows nothing that isn't already public in the repo's issues and comments, and it carries `noindex` so search engines skip it, per the owner's choice on #33. GitHub may delay scheduled runs, and disables them on public repos after 60 days without repo activity.

## Needs you

The page opens with one ordered list of everything waiting on the owner (L5). `launcher/swarm inbox` prints the same list. Both come from `needs_you()` in `generate.py`, so the page and the command always show the same items in the same order.

| Order | What | Within the kind |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sessions blocked on a `gov:question`, with the question | longest blocked first |
| 2 | Open `gov:question`s nobody is blocked on, with their time to live | oldest first |
| 3 | Open PRs that aren't drafts, waiting for review or merge | oldest first |
| 4 | Idle sessions: no event within the idle threshold | longest idle first |
| 5 | Sessions over their role's spend cap (warn only, GOV-0008) | furthest over first |

Each item links to its question, PR or session tracking issue. An empty list says "Nothing is waiting on you." The list is built only from the GitHub data below, so it shows nothing that isn't already public (GOV-0002, GOV-0004).

## Digest

`dashboard/digest.py` renders the same list as short Markdown for a pinned GitHub issue that the owner reads on GitHub mobile (v3 F2, GOV-0015):

```bash
python3 dashboard/digest.py --print    # prints the issue body; read-only
```

It starts with a hidden `<!-- productswarm-digest -->` marker and a count, then one heading per kind that has items, in the order above. Each bullet is the `#N` or `PR #N` reference, the title cut to about 60 characters, and the same detail and age as `swarm inbox`. Session items link to their tracking issue. It ends with the update time and the dashboard's Pages URL. It uses no tables, so nothing scrolls sideways on a phone. It reuses `fetch()`, `build()` and `needs_you()`, so it can't disagree with the page or `swarm inbox`, and like them it shows no local-only state (`watch.json` runs, held triggers, run cost). It never writes to GitHub; keeping the pinned issue current is F3's job.

## What it reads

- **Sessions:** `[heartbeat]` tracking issues (GOV-0003). An issue counts only if its body starts with the heartbeat marker and it was opened by a `productswarm-<role>[bot]` App. Events are read from the first `jsonl` fence of comments **by that same App**; events whose `session_id`, `role` or `repo` don't match the issue, or that carry fields outside the remote schema (such as `prompt`), are dropped. The local spool is never read, so prompt text never reaches the page (GOV-0002).
- **Open PRs** and the issues they close.
- **Open `gov:question` issues**, with the sessions blocked on each.

## Status

Per [heartbeat/SCHEMA.md](../heartbeat/SCHEMA.md):

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| stopped | latest event is `stopped`, or the tracking issue is closed |
| blocked | latest event other than `heartbeat`/`prompt_submitted` is `blocked`, and its gov question is still open |
| idle | no event for more than 15 minutes |
| active | otherwise |

A session's current issue is the most recent `issue` any of its events carried.

## Spend

Each session's spend, today's total and the last 7 UTC days are an **API list-price equivalent**, per the method in gov question #28. The owner asked for tokens to be split by payment plan if a session can tell. It can't without a new heartbeat field (#31), so every session is priced at list price whatever its plan. `spend.py` multiplies each session's latest cumulative `token_counts` by the model's list price. Cache writes are priced at the 1-hour rate. A non-null `cost_usd` on an event wins over the estimate. Per day is each session's increase in cost within that UTC day. This isn't what was billed: sessions on a subscription aren't charged per token.

Prices are in `spend.PRICES`, copied from the [pricing page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) on the date in `PRICES_AS_OF`, which the page shows. When prices change, update both. Sessions with no token counts, or on a model missing from the table, show "—", are left out of totals, and are listed under the method note.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s dashboard
```

They use canned data and a fake `gh`, and never touch GitHub.
